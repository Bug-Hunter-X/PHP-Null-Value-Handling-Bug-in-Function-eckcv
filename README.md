This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP concerning null value handling within functions. The `foo` function unexpectedly returns `null` if either `a` or `b` is `null`, even if the function could potentially handle these values. The solution shows how to explicitly handle null values appropriately.  This is a common issue leading to unexpected behavior and logic errors.
